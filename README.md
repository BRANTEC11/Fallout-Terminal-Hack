# Fallout-Terminal-Hack
Inspired by the hacking mini game from Fallout 3, NV and 4. You are given a long string of a mixture of words, symbols, and numbers. The main goal is to guess which of the words printed is the correct password. After you choose the wrong password, you are told how many of the letters in sequence match that of the correct password. For example, "BRAND" and "BREAK" would have 2/5 letters match because the 'B' and 'R' are both in the same position in both words. You can use this information to determine what remaining words can be the password and which of them cannot. In addition, in lieu of the traditional select closed parenthesis or brackets to remove duds or to get attempts back in the original game, instead, numbers are added so you can add all the numbers together and input that to get all of your attempts back, although this can only be used once per game. Also, at the end of the game, you can type in 'q' to exit the program, 'r' to restart the game, and 'ans' to display the answer to the previous game. Credit does to https://github.com/dwyl/english-words for his thorough compilation of English words for this game.
